# Salaries-Data-Project

This project takes a excel spreadsheet of multiple different jobs and their salaries, and visualizes the data.

By using our excel data, I managed to sort the data into data frames that would answer these questions when plotted on a graph.

The python features used in the project were: matplotlib, pandas and numpy.

A few questions that are answered in the code are:
1. When sorting by career, what are the differences in salaries?
2. What are the differences between companies and their given salaries for software engineers?
3. For software engineers and data scientists, what is the correlation between the amount of years of experience you have and your salary?
4. What locations pay data scientists the most?

For the Individual part of this assignment, I wanted asked this question:
What is the correlation between how many years you spend working for a company and your compensation for a software engineer?
